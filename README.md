# Travel-Suggestions-2025

This project will help create a perfect match and suggestions to your potential travel destination for 2025 through a set of questions and data. You will be able to chose from two categories, either a local state or international country and you will be able to view data visualizations pertaining to your choice and your match.

# To Install:

To "install", simply fork the github repository and you will be able to see the codes organized in different sections (based on the function and order of the results) and it contains a combination of classes, dictionaries, iterations, functions, error handling, and API usage. 

# How to Use:

Simply run the program and you will be introduced to your first question asking where you would like to find your match in. Once you decide you will be able to see a line graph displaying the top 10 options for your category and you will be asked 3 questions afterwards. Each question will require the answers to be between specific values and will display error messages asking user to try again if their answer doesn't match the requirements/options. Afterwards, you'll recieve your match along with a short description. You will need to scroll down to the end and you will be able to see different travel suggestions and details pertaining to the travel match (through TripAdvisor API) along with a 5-day weather forecast (through OpenWeather API), and a final thank you message.
